# Graphical Passwords as a Method to Protect Against Shoulder-Surfing

## Marcus Torzewski

This was my third year solo project during my time at Leicester. It featured a Java SWT program compromising multiple graphical password methodologies for user testing (which I also carried out). The installation instructions apply to the uni system, but the .jar file should work if JRE 57.0 is installed.

## Installation instructions

The primary way to view the running program is through the .jar file titled project in the root of the repository. It has been tested and works on Windows 10 with JRE 57.0. It will likely be downloaded as a .jar.zip. Simply remove the .zip extension and it should run.

The project code is contained entirely within the 'prototypes' java project. This can be imported into Eclipse alongside the 'org.eclipse.SWT' library also present in the repo. The project compiles with Java 13. This works on Windows 10, with Eclipse 2021-09. This should work automatically and no additional set up should be needed. 'src.prototypes.main.java' is the main java class for the entire project. It does not work on the Linux machines due to unknown reasons.

The 'SWT-Practice' project contains a few simple SWT classes that follow some online tutorials. These were done to familiarise myself with SWT. The tutorials used are listed inside the classes as comments and in the resources-index.txt.

## Resources

The resources used are listed in the sources-index.txt found in 'prototypes.res.resources'. Here you can see the links to images/icons used and tutorials followed for the 'SWT-Practice' files. All images and icons were free for non-commercial use.

## Project Files Folder

The 'Project Files' folder contains non-software project artefacts. These include the software test plan, the original and updated gantt charts for the project, and mockup images for the designs of the software.
